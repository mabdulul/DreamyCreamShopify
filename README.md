# Purpose and Goal
Dreamy Cream is a freelance e-commencer site that I work for Rayya Ulusoy. She needed a site that contained her color schema and important shipping information and FAQ page. I created the site with Shopify because it was easy to use, and I didn't need any additional plugins. I also needed to ensure that the site was customizable.

# Problems/Solutions
The main problem I had was learning how to use the Shopify interface and learning liquid. However, after watching tutorials, and reading the documentation it was easy to pick up.
